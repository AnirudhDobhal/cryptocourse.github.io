You are an expert frontend developer. Build a modern, responsive, STATIC website for **CryptoCourses.in** to raise awareness about cryptocurrency. 

### Tech & Constraints
- Tech stack: **HTML5 + CSS3 only** (no frameworks, no build tools). 
- Deliver clean, semantic markup and a single well-organized CSS file using CSS variables and utility classes where helpful.
- Must be fast, accessible (WCAG AA), and mobile-first responsive.

### Visual Style
- Modern, trustworthy, educational vibe.
- Color palette: 
  -- Primary: #5B8DEF (educational blue), 
  -- Accent: #14C38E (trust/verification green), 
  -- Dark: #0B1021, 
  -- Light: #F5F7FB.
- Typography: system stack with clear hierarchy; larger headings; comfortable line-height.
- Soft cards, subtle shadows, plenty of white space; rounded-2xl corners.
- Support **dark mode** with `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`.

    (empty; do not use unless strictly necessary for video fallback)

### Global Requirements
- Reusable header with logo “CryptoCourses.in”, nav (Home, Blogs, Resources, About, FAQ, Contact), and a prominent **CTA: “Start Learning”** linking to Resources.
- Reusable footer with quick links, social icons (SVG), newsletter signup (mailto or comment a Formspree placeholder), and legal (Privacy, Terms).
- SEO: unique `<title>`, meta description, Open Graph/Twitter meta, canonical link.
- Schema.org JSON-LD:
  - `Organization` on all pages.
  - `BreadcrumbList` where relevant.
  - `Article` on blog posts.
- Accessibility: semantic landmarks (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `footer`), alt text, focus states, ARIA labels, sufficient color contrast.

### Home (index.html)
Sections (each in its own `<section>` with an id):
1. **Hero**: punchy headline (“Understand Crypto the Right Way”), subhead, CTA buttons (“Watch Intro Video”, “Start Learning”).
2. **Explainer Video**: embed a poster + `<video>` source (mp4) and fallback YouTube iframe. Short caption describing what viewers will learn.
3. **What is Crypto & Why It’s Safe**: clear, jargon-free explanation; cover cryptography, decentralization, public blockchains, and security best practices. Include a “Myths vs Facts” 3-card row.
4. **Learning Path**: 3–4 cards (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Safety & Compliance); each with outcomes and estimated time.
5. **Featured Blogs**: 3 latest posts with image, excerpt, tag chips, “Read more”.
6. **Safety & Responsible Use**: bullet list on wallet security, scams, volatility; add a clear **not financial advice** disclaimer.
7. **Testimonials**: 3 short quotes (placeholders) to establish trust.
8. **Callout**: newsletter signup (mailto) and CTA to Resources.

### Blogs
- **blog.html**: grid of posts with filters by tag (no JS; use anchor links and CSS-only tabs or simply present categories).
- Each post (in /blog/*.html) must include:
  - Hero title, author, date (ISO format), estimated read time.
  - Table of contents (in-page anchors).
  - Clear subheadings, code blocks where useful, diagrams via simple SVGs.
  - Key takeaways list at the end.
  - `Article` JSON-LD.

Create these sample posts with original explanatory content (no copying):
- what-is-crypto.html
- crypto-safety-myths.html
- blockchain-basics.html

### Resources (resources.html)
- Curated sections: “Start Here”, “Wallets & Security”, “Block Explorers”, “Learning Hubs”, “Regulatory & Tax Basics (Country-agnostic)”.
- For each item, provide a short neutral description and a placeholder link (`#`) with rel attributes set for safety; remind users links are examples.

### About (about.html)
- Mission, who we help, editorial guidelines (impartial, educational, risk disclosures).
- Small team section with placeholder avatars.

### FAQ (faq.html)
- 12–15 Q&As focusing on fundamentals, safety, volatility, wallets, scams, fees, and how blockchains work. Keep answers concise and non-advisory.

### Contact (contact.html)
- Simple contact form (Name, Email, Topic, Message). Use `mailto:` action or comment a Formspree placeholder. Include address placeholder and social links.

### Legal (privacy.html, terms.html)
- Plain-English templates suitable for an educational site, no data sales, cookie note (static site), and strong “not financial advice” clause.

### “Check other crypto websites” instruction
- Synthesize common UX patterns seen on leading crypto education sites (hero + explainer video, myth-busting, learning paths, glossaries, safety callouts, FAQs), but **do not copy** any text. Keep tone neutral and educational.

### Performance
- Optimize images (use SVG where possible), add `loading="lazy"` to images/iframes, minify CSS (but keep a readable source version), preconnect for YouTube if used.
- Use responsive images and proper `<meta name="viewport">`.

### Extras
- Add a small **Glossary** component in Resources (accordion or simple list, CSS-only).
- Include a “Report an issue” mailto link in the footer.
- Favicon and app icons placeholders.

### Delivery
- Provide all HTML files and `css/styles.css` fully implemented with sample content and placeholders where links aren’t final.
- Code should be clean, commented, and easy to extend. 
- After generating, include a short README section as an HTML comment in index.html describing how to add new blog posts and adjust colors/branding.
