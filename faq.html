                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Cryptocurrency uses cryptographic proofs and distributed consensus instead of central authorities. Traditional digital money relies on banks to validate transactions, while cryptocurrency networks use mathematical protocols like proof-of-work or proof-of-stake to achieve agreement without trusted intermediaries.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h2 class="faq-question">How do digital signatures work in cryptocurrency?</h2>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Digital signatures use elliptic curve cryptography (typically ECDSA with secp256k1) to prove transaction authorization. Your private key creates a mathematical signature that others can verify using your public key, proving you authorized the transaction without revealing your private key.</p>

                        <h2 class="faq-question">Why are cryptocurrency transaction fees necessary?</h2>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Transaction fees serve multiple purposes: they prioritize transactions during network congestion, compensate miners/validators for processing costs, and prevent spam attacks. Fees create economic incentives for network participants to maintain security and functionality.</p>

                        <h2 class="faq-question">What is the difference between hot and cold storage?</h2>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Hot storage keeps private keys on internet-connected devices for convenience but increases attack surface. Cold storage keeps keys offline (hardware wallets, paper, air-gapped computers) providing better security at the cost of accessibility. Most users should use cold storage for significant holdings.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Consensus mechanisms like proof-of-work and proof-of-stake create economic incentives for participants to agree on valid transactions. These protocols ensure that honest participants following the rules are rewarded, while malicious actors face costs that exceed potential gains.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Smart contracts are programs that run on blockchain networks, automatically executing when predetermined conditions are met. They operate deterministically - given the same inputs, they produce the same outputs - and their execution is verified by the network consensus mechanism.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Cryptocurrency markets are relatively new with lower liquidity than traditional assets. Price discovery occurs through speculation, adoption changes, regulatory developments, and technological progress. Most cryptocurrencies lack fundamental value anchors, leading to higher volatility than established asset classes.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Use blockchain explorers to view transaction data: inputs, outputs, signatures, and confirmations. Verify that the transaction hash appears in a block that's part of the longest valid chain. Each confirmation represents additional blocks built on top, increasing security.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Lost private keys mean permanent loss of access to associated funds. Cryptocurrency networks cannot reverse transactions or recover keys - this is by design for security. Always maintain secure backups of seed phrases and consider multi-signature setups for significant holdings.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Verify all addresses through multiple channels, never share private keys or seed phrases, be skeptical of guaranteed returns, research projects thoroughly, use reputable exchanges and wallets, and understand that legitimate support will never ask for your private information.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Proof-of-work mining consumes significant energy (Bitcoin uses ~120 TWh annually), but studies suggest 50-70% comes from renewable sources. Proof-of-stake systems like Ethereum 2.0 reduce energy consumption by over 99%. Mining also drives renewable energy development and grid efficiency.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Regulations can impact adoption, trading venues, tax treatment, and technical development. Decentralized networks continue operating regardless of local regulations, but user access and institutional participation may change. Stay informed about jurisdiction-specific requirements.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) uses smart contracts to recreate financial services without traditional intermediaries. Protocols for lending, trading, and yield generation operate through algorithmic rules rather than human management, though they inherit smart contract risks and complexity.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Examine the consensus mechanism, review code audits, assess decentralization metrics, evaluate the development team's track record, check for formal verification, analyze economic incentives, and understand governance structures. No project is risk-free; diversify accordingly.</p>

                            <p>Tax treatment varies by jurisdiction but generally includes capital gains on sales, income from mining/staking, and reporting requirements for transactions above certain thresholds. Maintain detailed records and consult qualified tax professionals familiar with digital assets in your area.</p>
